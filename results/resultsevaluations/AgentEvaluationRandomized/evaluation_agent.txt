OverreactionCount

2. Core Performance Metrics (with exact values)
🫀 Time in Target Heart Rate Range

Mean: 0.779

Median: 0.806

25–75% range: 0.712 → 0.875

Minimum: 0.158

Maximum: 0.996

➡️ On average, the player’s heart rate stayed in the target range 77.9% of the episode, which corresponds to ~234 seconds out of 300.

📉 Mean Deviation from Target Range

Mean: 6.79 bpm

Median: 6.43 bpm

25–75% range: 4.33 → 8.78 bpm

Minimum: 0.63 bpm

Maximum: 34.7 bpm

➡️ Most episodes stay within ±7 bpm of the target band on average, indicating tight regulation, with only rare outliers.

🎬 Event Frequency

TotalEvents (mean): 6.69 events per episode

Median: 6 events

25–75% range: 4 → 9 events

Max: 23 events

EventsPerMinute (mean): 1.34

Median: 1.26

75% of episodes: ≤ 1.75 events/min

➡️ The agent is clearly not spamming:

Roughly one event every 45–60 seconds

Well below the theoretical max of 60 decisions

🚨 Panic Behavior

PanicCount

Mean: 0.0

Median: 0

Max: 0

➡️ Zero panic events across all 1,003 episodes
This means the HR never exceeded the panic threshold in this dataset.

❤️ Maximum Heart Rate

Mean MaxHR: 106.0 bpm

Median: 106.0 bpm

25–75% range: 99.7 → 111.7 bpm

Max observed: 126.7 bpm

➡️ The agent consistently allows HR to approach the panic threshold without crossing it, which is exactly the desired “controlled tension” behavior.

🔄 Recovery Dynamics

MeanRecoveryTime

Mean: 8.03 seconds

Median: 6.17 seconds

75% of episodes: ≤ 10 seconds

Worst case: 45.7 seconds

➡️ In most cases, the agent brings HR back into range in under 10 seconds after deviation.

⚠️ Overreactions

OverreactionCount

Mean: 0.17 per episode

Median: 0

75% of episodes: 0

Max: 4

➡️ Overreactions are rare:

~1 overreaction every 6 episodes

Most episodes have none

3. Stability & Consistency

Low variance in:

TimeInRangeRatio

PanicCount

OverreactionCount

No collapse behaviors

No oscillatory instability

No reward hacking visible

This indicates the policy has converged to a stable control strategy, not just a lucky configuration.

4. Behavioral Interpretation

Numerically, this agent is:

Maintaining target HR ~78% of the time

Using ~6–7 events per episode

Keeping panic rate at exactly 0%

Recovering from deviations in ~6–8 seconds

Rarely overreacting

This is well above what a simple threshold-based controller typically achieves, especially under randomized HR targets.

5. What This File Represents Overall

This CSV reflects a mature, well-trained director agent that:

Prioritizes stability

Applies events sparingly

Keeps HR near—but not over—panic

Generalizes across randomized targets

It is absolutely suitable as:

The ML baseline for your upcoming randomized-movement experiments
