2. Interpretation by Metric
🫀 Time in Target Heart Rate Range

Mean: 79.1%

Median: 82.5%

75% of episodes ≥ 91.7%

This is strong but not perfect control:

Most episodes keep the player in-range 4 out of 5 seconds

However, the lower tail (min ≈ 2.8%) shows occasional failure cases

📏 Mean Deviation from Target

Mean: 7.39 bpm

Median: 6.78 bpm

Worst case: 24.1 bpm

This suggests:

The system generally hovers within ~7 bpm of the target

Rare but significant overshoots still occur

This deviation is moderate — acceptable for horror pacing, but improvable.

🎬 Event Usage

6.8 events per episode

2.23 events per minute (episode length ≈ 300s)

Interpretation:

The director is active but not spammy

Compared to naive controllers, this is a balanced intervention rate

😱 Panic Behavior

Mean PanicCount: 0.19

Median: 0

Max: 58

Important nuance:

Most episodes have zero panic

A small number of catastrophic episodes dominate the average

This is a classic long-tail failure pattern:

The policy is usually safe, but sometimes completely loses control.

🔥 Maximum Heart Rate

Mean MaxHR: 108.6 bpm

Median: 107.6 bpm

Upper quartile: 116.7 bpm

Worst case: 155.7 bpm

Interpretation:

Typical episodes stay below or near panic threshold

Rare episodes push deep into panic territory

⏱ Recovery Time

Mean: 8.7 s

Median: 5.8 s

Worst case: 133 s

This tells us:

Most recoveries are fast (≤ 6 seconds)

When failure occurs, recovery can be very slow

🚫 Overreaction

Always 0

This is excellent:

No oscillation

No event spamming

No corrective overshoot loops

3. What This File Represents Behaviorally

This controller (or agent snapshot):

✅ Keeps HR in range ~80% of the time
✅ Uses events at a reasonable, human-like rate
✅ Avoids oscillations entirely
⚠️ Has rare but severe failure episodes
⚠️ Panic spikes dominate worst-case metrics

In short:

Stable most of the time, but not yet robust to edge cases.

4. Comparison to an Ideal Target
Metric	This File	Ideal Goal
TimeInRange	79%	≥ 85–90%
MeanDeviation	7.4 bpm	≤ 5 bpm
PanicCount	0.19	~0
RecoveryTime	8.7 s	≤ 5 s
Overreaction	0	0

You are close, but robustness is the missing piece.
