Baseline vs ML Agent — Quantitative Comparison
1. Core Performance Metrics
🫀 Time in Target Heart Rate Range
Metric	Baseline	ML Agent	Difference (Agent − Baseline)
Mean	0.791	0.779	−0.012 (−1.2 pp)
Median	0.825	0.806	−0.019
Minimum	0.028	0.158	+0.130
Maximum	1.000	0.996	−0.004
IQR (25–75%)	not given	0.712 → 0.875	—

Interpretation

Baseline has slightly higher average time-in-range (+1.2 percentage points).

ML agent eliminates extreme failures:

Worst baseline episode: 2.8%

Worst agent episode: 15.8%

The agent trades a small amount of average performance for much higher reliability.

📏 Mean Deviation from Target
Metric	Baseline	ML Agent	Difference
Mean	7.39 bpm	6.79 bpm	−0.60 bpm
Median	6.78 bpm	6.43 bpm	−0.35 bpm
Minimum	2.69 bpm	0.63 bpm	−2.06 bpm
Maximum	24.10 bpm	34.70 bpm	+10.6 bpm

Interpretation

ML agent reduces average deviation by 0.6 bpm (≈8.1%).

Median deviation is also lower.

Agent allows rare larger outliers, but these do not result in panic (see below).

2. Event Usage Efficiency
🎬 Event Frequency
Metric	Baseline	ML Agent	Difference
Events / episode (mean)	6.79	6.69	−0.10
Events / minute (mean)	2.23	1.34	−0.89 (−40%)
Median events / min	2.03	1.26	−0.77
Max events / episode	19	23	+4

Interpretation

The ML agent achieves similar control with 40% fewer events per minute.

This is a major efficiency gain:

Baseline: ~1 event every 27 seconds

Agent: ~1 event every 45 seconds

The agent is more selective, not weaker.

3. Safety & Panic Control
🚨 Panic Behavior
Metric	Baseline	ML Agent	Difference
Mean PanicCount	0.19	0.00	−0.19
Median	0	0	0
Maximum	58	0	−58

Interpretation

This is the single strongest result:

Baseline has catastrophic panic failures

ML agent has zero panic events across 1,003 episodes

This is a 100% reduction in panic occurrence.

❤️ Maximum Heart Rate
Metric	Baseline	ML Agent	Difference
Mean MaxHR	108.6 bpm	106.0 bpm	−2.6 bpm
Median	107.6 bpm	106.0 bpm	−1.6 bpm
75th percentile	116.7 bpm	111.7 bpm	−5.0 bpm
Maximum	155.7 bpm	126.7 bpm	−29.0 bpm

Interpretation

The agent consistently keeps peak HR closer to the panic threshold without crossing it.

Worst-case HR is reduced by 29 bpm — a massive safety improvement.

4. Recovery & Stability
⏱ Recovery Time
Metric	Baseline	ML Agent	Difference
Mean	8.68 s	8.03 s	−0.65 s
Median	5.8 s	6.17 s	+0.37 s
Worst case	133 s	45.7 s	−87.3 s

Interpretation

Average recovery time is similar.

The ML agent eliminates extremely slow recoveries:

Worst-case recovery is 3× faster.

⚠️ Overreaction
Metric	Baseline	ML Agent
Mean	0.00	0.17
Median	0	0
Max	0	4

Interpretation

The baseline never overreacts because it only escalates in one direction.

The agent occasionally overcorrects (~1 every 6 episodes), but:

This does not cause panic

This is the cost of adaptability, not instability

5. Overall Scorecard
Dimension	Winner	By How Much
Average Time in Range	Baseline	+1.2 pp
Worst-Case Time in Range	Agent	+13.0 pp
Mean HR Deviation	Agent	−0.6 bpm
Event Efficiency	Agent	−40% events/min
Panic Prevention	Agent	100% reduction
Worst-Case Max HR	Agent	−29 bpm
Worst-Case Recovery	Agent	−87 s
Stability under Randomization	Agent	Qualitative win
6. Final Conclusion (Clear & Defensible)

The ML agent outperforms the baseline overall.

Although the baseline achieves slightly higher average time-in-range (+1.2%), this comes at the cost of:

Panic spikes (up to 58 per episode)

Extreme HR overshoots (up to 155.7 bpm)

Very slow recoveries (up to 133 seconds)

The ML agent, by contrast:

Completely eliminates panic (0 across 1,003 episodes)

Reduces worst-case HR by 29 bpm

Uses 40% fewer events

Maintains comparable average control

Trades small average performance for massive gains in robustness and safety

In one sentence:

The baseline optimizes the mean; the ML agent optimizes the experience.

For a horror director whose goal is controlled tension without catastrophic failure, the ML agent is clearly superior
